# House-Price-Prediction

The Boston Housing dataset contains information about various factors affecting housing prices in the Boston area. It includes features such as the per capita crime rate, average number of rooms per dwelling, proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 square feet, and more.

Columns:

CRIM: per capita crime rate by town

ZN: proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.

INDUS: proportion of non-retail business acres per town

CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)

NOX: nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)

RM: average number of rooms per dwelling

AGE: proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940

DIS: weighted distances to five Boston employment centres

RAD: index of accessibility to radial highways

TAX: full-value property-tax rate per $10,000

PTRATIO: pupil-teacher ratio by town

B: 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of [people of African American descent] by town

LSTAT: % lower status of the population

MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s (target variable)

Predicting House prices is one of the most common application of machine learning algorithm such as Linear Regression.

Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm is trained via correct output labels. Linear regression is a linear model that assumes a linear relationship between inputs and outputs and minimizes the cost error between predicted and actual values using gradient descent.

Why use Linear Regression algorithm?

Linear regression algorithm is particularly use when:

Linear regression is simple to implement and easily interpretable algorithm.

Take less training time to train even for large datasets.

Linear regression coeffiecients are easy to implement.
